- ðŸŒ± I geek out over front-end tools like React.js, React Native and Next.js, and I'm no stranger to the backend with Node.js ,but still on my way around Python. I love turning ideas into reality and making things work like a charm.
- ðŸ‘¯ When I'm not coding, I'm probably exploring the latest tech buzz, tinkering with side projects, or geeking out on some new coding challenge. Let's connect and create something awesome together! ðŸš€âœ¨
